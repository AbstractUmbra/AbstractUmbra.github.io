Welcome, this post is about the different types of select menus and how to use them.

[View Documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#select-menus)

This post shows how to define the different types of select menus, and how to use them.

# Select
(technically called a "string select")
This is the most basic select menu, it allows the user to select from a list of custom provided options.
**Note:** You can only have up to 25 options.

**Example:**
{% highlight python %}
import discord
from discord.ui import Select


class FruitSelect(Select):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            placeholder="Select a favorite fruit...",
            # our options
            options=[
                discord.SelectOption(label="Apple", value="apple"),
                discord.SelectOption(label="Orange", value="orange"),
                discord.SelectOption(label="Banana", value="banana"),
            ]
        )

    async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> None:
        selected_fruit: str = self.values[0]
        await interaction.response.send_message(
            f"{interaction.user.mention}'s favorite fruit is {selected_fruit}!"
        )
{% endhighlight %}

Sending that as a view will result in a select menu that looks like this:
![string_select](\static\images\selects\string_select.png)

# Auto populated selects
*discord.py v2.1+ required*

These are select menus that are populated automatically by Discord, they are not *really* customizable.

- You can not filter the members, roles or channels shown.
- You can set the min/max amount of options the user can or must choose using the `min_values` and `max_values` kwargs.
- You can choose the type of channels that are shown. (ChannelSelect)
- You can specify the options that should be selected by default using the `default_values` kwarg. (*requires discord.py v2.4+*)
- Only the first 25 options will be shown, the rest can be searched for using the search bar, which has auto-complete.

## UserSelect
This is a select menu that allows the user to select from a list of members in the server. Or, if used in a DM, you and the bot.

Code is mostly the same as the example above, except we use `UserSelect` instead of `Select`:
{% highlight python %}
from discord.ui import UserSelect
{% endhighlight %}
And [`values`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.UserSelect.values) is a list of [`discord.Member`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#member) or [`discord.User`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#user) objects:
{% highlight python %}
async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> Any:
    users: List[Union[discord.Member, discord.User]] = self.values
    selected_users = [
        f"Name: {user.name}, ID: {user.id}"
        for user in users
    ]
    await interaction.response.send_message(
        f"{interaction.user.mention} selected the following users:\n" + "\n".join(selected_users)
    )
{% endhighlight %}

## RoleSelect
This is a select menu that allows the user to select from a list of roles in the server.

Code is mostly the same as the example above, except we use `RoleSelect` instead of `Select`:
{% highlight python %}
from discord.ui import RoleSelect
{% endhighlight %}
And [`values`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.RoleSelect.values) is a list of [`discord.Role`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#role) objects:
{% highlight python %}
async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> Any:
    roles: List[discord.Role] = self.values
    selected_roles = [
        f"Name: {role.name}, ID: {role.id}"
        for role in roles
    ]
    await interaction.response.send_message(
        f"{interaction.user.mention} selected the following roles:\n" + "\n".join(selected_roles)
    )
{% endhighlight %}

## MentionableSelect
This is a select menu that allows the user to select from a list of members and roles in the server. Or, if used in a DM, you and the bot.

Code is mostly the same as the example above, except we use `MentionableSelect` instead of `Select`:
{% highlight python %}
from discord.ui import MentionableSelect
{% endhighlight %}

And [`values`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.MentionableSelect.values) is a list of [`discord.Member`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#member), [`discord.User`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#user) and [`discord.Role`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#role) objects:
{% highlight python %}
async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> Any:
    mentionables: List[Union[discord.Member, discord.User, discord.Role]] = self.values
    selected_users = [
        f"Name: {user.name}, ID: {user.id}"
        for user in mentionables
        if isinstance(user, (discord.Member, discord.User))
    ]
    selected_roles = [
        f"Name: {role.name}, ID: {role.id}"
        for role in mentionables
        if isinstance(role, discord.Role)
    ]
    await interaction.response.send_message(
        (
            f"{interaction.user.mention} selected the following users:\n" + "\n".join(selected_users),
            f"{interaction.user.mention} selected the following roles:\n" + "\n".join(selected_roles),
        )

    )
{% endhighlight %}

## ChannelSelect
This is a select menu that allows the user to select from a list of channels in the server.

Code is mostly the same as the example above, except we use `ChannelSelect` instead of `Select` and we can use the `channel_types` kwarg to limit the type of channels shown, all channels are shown by default:
{% highlight python %}
from discord import ChannelType
from discord.app_commands import AppCommandChannnel, AppCommandThread
from discord.ui import ChannelSelect
{% endhighlight %}

And [`values`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#discord.ui.ChannelSelect.values) is a list of [`discord.AppCommandChannnel`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#appcommandchannel) or [`discord.AppcommandThread`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interactions/api.html#appcommandthread) objects:
{% highlight python %}

class ChannelsSelector(ChannelSelect):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            placeholder="Select a channel...",
            # limit the type of channels shown to text, voice and threads
            channel_types=[ChannelType.text, ChannelType.voice, ChannelType.thread]

async def callback(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> Any:
    channels: List[Union[AppCommandChannnel, AppCommandThread]] = self.values
    selected_channels = [
        f"Name: {channel.name}, ID: {channel.id}"
        for channel in channels
    ]
    await interaction.response.send_message(
        f"{interaction.user.mention} selected the following channels:\n" + "\n".join(selected_channels)
    )
{% endhighlight %}

## default_values
*discord.py v2.4+ required*

This was briefly mentioned above, but you can specify the options that should be selected by default using the `default_values` kwarg.

The kwarg takes a list of objects, the type of which depends on the type of select menu.
There is also special class for it called `SelectDefaultValue` which takes the `id` of a user, role of channel and the `type` of the object.

{% highlight python %}
import discord
from discord import ui

class ChooseAnyoneExceptMe(ui.View):
    def __init__(self, bot_owner_id: int):
        super().__init__()

        # set the default values of the user select to the bot owner, so they can't select me!
        self.user_select.default_values = [
            discord.SelectDefaultValue(id=bot_owner_id, type=discord.SelectDefaultType.user)
        ]

    @ui.select(cls=ui.UserSelect, placeholder="Select my owner...")
    async def user_select(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, select: ui.UserSelect) -> None:
        selected_user = select.values[0]
        # yes, we are very sure that the selected user is not the bot owner.
        await interaction.response.send_message(
            f"{selected_user.mention} is not my owner!"
        )

{% endhighlight %}

# Decorator
The select menus can also be defined using a decorator in a `View` subclass and specifying the `cls` kwarg:
{% highlight python %}

from discord import ui


class SelectView(ui.View):
    # string select
    # @ui.select(placeholder="Select an option...". options=[...])
    # or @ui.select(cls=ui.Select, placeholder="Select an option...". options=[...])

    # user select
    # @ui.select(cls=ui.UserSelect, placeholder="Select a user...")
    # role select
    # @ui.select(cls=ui.RoleSelect, placeholder="Select a role...")
    # mentionable select
    # @ui.select(cls=ui.MentionableSelect, placeholder="Select a role or user...")

    # channel select
    # only text, voice and threads are shown
    @ui.select(cls=ui.ChannelSelect, channel_types=[ChannelType.text, ChannelType.voice, ChannelType.thread], placeholder="Select a channel...")
    async def channel_select(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, select: ui.ChannelSelect) -> None:
        ...
{% endhighlight %}
